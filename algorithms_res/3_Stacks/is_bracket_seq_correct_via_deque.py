	Note

	A bracket sequence is called correct if it can be obtained from any mathematical expression by crossing out all symbols except brackets.

	The formal definition of the correct bracket sequence is:

	    Empty sequence is correct.
	    If A is a regular bracket sequence, then (A), [A] and {A} are regular bracket sequences.
	    If A and B are regular bracket sequences, then AB is a regular bracket sequence.
